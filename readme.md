# Web Server & Framework Mashup

This project aims to build a Python web server and framework inspired by both **Django** and **FastAPI**. The goal is to combine the best features of both frameworks, providing a modern, fast, and flexible foundation for web development.

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Construction**  
The project is in its early stages. Core features and architecture are actively being developed.

## Vision

- **Django-like structure:** Emphasize modularity, reusability, and convention-over-configuration.
- **FastAPI-like speed:** Leverage async capabilities for high performance and scalability.
- **Developer Experience:** Simple, intuitive APIs and tooling.

## Getting Started

Stay tuned! Setup instructions and usage examples will be added as development progresses.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

The server will start and be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` by default.
